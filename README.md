# OldPatreonExclusiveThings
A collection of assets and tools that I used to distribute through Patreon exclusively. As my time on patreon has come to an end, I am releasing these assets for free!

If the asset is in this repository, it means that it will no longer be maintained or updated regularly. 

Please don't ask for support on these, as I will not respond to those support requests!

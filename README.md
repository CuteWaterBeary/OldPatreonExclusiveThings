# OldPatreonExclusiveThings
A collection of assets and tools that I used to distribute through Patreon exclusively. As my time on patreon has come to an end, I am releasing these assets for free!

__Note: This repository will only contain things that were exclusive to Patreon. Assets that are also on booth will not be here.__

__If the asset is in this repository, it means that it will no longer be maintained or updated regularly.__

__Please don't ask for support on these, as I will not respond to those support requests!__
